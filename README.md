# Advent of Code 2022 üéÑ

## About

Hello world! This repository contains solutions to [`adventofcode`](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles for the year 2022.

* My solutions will primarily be in the [Python](https://python.org) programming language, but I am intending to add solutions in some auxiliary languages that I've been looking to learn as well.
* I'll be using [`Python 3.10`](https://docs.python.org/3.10/whatsnew/3.10.html)
* My submissions maybe erratic. I will also not submit solutions until at least 24 hours after the problem has released.
* I am also not intending to use 3rd party libraries and using the standard library only.
* Feedback on my solutions are welcome and appreciated. See [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details.
